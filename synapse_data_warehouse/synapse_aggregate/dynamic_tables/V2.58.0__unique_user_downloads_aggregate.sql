COMMENT = 'This table contains download aggregates across yearly, quarterly, monthly, and daily periods. Aggregates for these periods are computed for various combinations of the project, object type, and object identifier dimensions.

h3. Understanding Aggregates

Aggregates are computed over specific time periods, as well as over specific cross-sections of other non-time columns or dimensions.

h4. Aggregates over Time Periods

Aggregates over a given time period are labeled in `agg_period`:

* YEARLY
* QUARTERLY
* MONTHLY
* DAILY

h4. Aggregates over Data Dimensions

Aggregates over various non-time, data dimensions are labeled in `agg_level`:

* *OBJECT WITHIN PROJECT* - Aggregates for objects within a given project. This encompasses only "FileEntity" and "TableEntity" `object_type`s.
* *OBJECT* - Aggregates for objects which don\'t associate with a project. This encompasses all other `object_type`s. Note that we do not provide _cross-project_ download aggregates for FileEntity or TableEntity objects.
* *OBJECT TYPE WITHIN PROJECT* - Aggregates for an object type within a given project. This only applies to object types which associate with a project: FileEntity and TableEntity.
* *PROJECT* - Aggregates for _all_ objects within a given project. This encompasses FileEntity and TableEntity object types.
* *OBJECT TYPE* - Aggregates for an object type, regardless of project.
* *ALL OBJECTS* - Aggregates for all objects within Synapse. Note that this encompasses only those object types provided in `object_type`.'
