ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE USERPROFILE_LATEST SET COMMENT = 'This dynamic table contains the most recent snapshot of user profiles from the past 14 days. The latest snapshots are determined by the most recent CHANGE_TIMESTAMP and SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP. If multiple snapshots exist within this period, only the latest snapshot for each ID is retained. For easier querying, NULL values in the LOCATION, COMPANY, POSITION, and INDUSTRY columns are replaced with empty strings. Since snapshotting does not capture DELETE changes, records may still be retained if a user was deleted within the past 14 days.'; 
ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE FILE_LATEST SET COMMENT = 'This dynamic table contains the most recent snapshot of files from the past 30 days. The latest snapshots are determined by the most recent CHANGE_TIMESTAMP and SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP. If multiple snapshots exist within this period, only the latest snapshot for each ID is retained.';

ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE TEAMMEMBER_LATEST SET COMMENT = 'This dynamic table contains the most recent snapshot of team members from the past 14 days. The latest snapshots are determined by the most recent CHANGE_TIMESTAMP and SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP. If multiple snapshots exist within this period, only the latest snapshot for each TEAM_ID and MEMBER_ID pair is retained. Since snapshotting does not capture DELETE changes, records may still be retained if a team member was deleted within the past 14 days.';
