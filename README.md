# snowflake

This repository will house all the configuration, and data exploration of data that will be often executed.  Configurations include warehouse, database, schema, table, user, role and other configurations. The managed access of snowflake will be governed by [RBAC](https://medium.com/snowflake/managed-access-schema-framework-in-rbac-1b63341be418)

Follow the steps below to get access to snowflake: https://mqzfhld-vp00034.snowflakecomputing.com

1. Ask internally at Sage for snowflake access.  You are permitted to explore in the UI, but long standing views and tables should be created via PR and will be created via the SYSADMIN role by users that can assume the sysadmin privilege.
1. Enable vscode snowflake extension. Follow instructions here https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/vscode-ext
